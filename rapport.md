### Part 1 : 
If my writing is too bad to read, please reach out to me, and I'll happily clarify everything !
Problem 1 to 7 : 
![Ex1 Part1 1-7](images\Ex2\Ex1Part1_1-7.jpeg)
### Part 2
1. Square matrix
   1. A square matrix has the same number of columns as it has of rows. 
2. Column matrix
   1. A column matrix has dimension nx1, so it only has one column. It looks vertical => Tall
3. Row matrix
   1. A row matrix has dimension 1xm, so it has many columns but only one row => Wide
4. Identity matrix
   1. The identity matrix has its diagonal element all at 1 (when n = m), and the rest of its element at 0 (when n =/= m). It is **always** square. 
   2. In a way, it is a sort of permuation matrix.
5. Diagonal matrix
   1. The diagonal matrix is similar to the identity matrix, but inversed : when n=m (its diagonal), the element is any number but 0. When not, the number is 0.
6. symmetric matrix
   1. A symmetric matrix has a symmetry access along its diagonal (when n=m).
7. Permutation matrix
   1. A permuation matrix is a matrix that has only one 1 per row **AND** per column. 
   2. The rest of the elements are 0. 
   3. It is always square
8. Upper triangular matrix
   1. An upper triangular matrix is a matrixe where the element below the diagonal (when n>m) are all 0. 
   2. The diagonal itself can be any number.
9.  Lower triangular matrix
    1.  A lower triangular matrix is a matrixe where the element above (when n<m) the diagonal are all 0.

### Part 1 : Definition of linear dependance
The definition of linear dependence for a set of vectors can be written as : 
$$\beta_1 \alpha_1 + \cdots + \beta_k \alpha_k = 0$$
where $\{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_k\}$ are all n-vectors. In the above notation, the set of vectors $\alpha$ is linearly dependant if there are solutions for the notation to be corret other than by setting all $\beta=0$.

Is $\{0, 0\}$ linearly dependent ? 

We can multiply the $\{0, 0\}$ vector by any $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ and still get a correct value. Example : 

$$\beta \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \vec{0}$$
Correct values include : 
$$1 \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \vec{0}, \quad 2 \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \vec{0}, \quad -1 \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \vec{0}.$$

Since the set of possible answers $\beta$ is more than just 0, it is linearly dependent.

Are $\{1, 0\}$ and $\{2, 10\}$ linearly dependent ?

Since $\{2, 10\} = 2 \{1, 5\}$, they are linearly dependent.

Note : When checking for linear (in)dependence, we do not need to write the $\vec{0}$ target vector inside of the matrice, because it would always remain 0 no matter what. So, we do not need to build an augmented matrice. The process remain the exact same nonetheless.

### Part 2 : DÃ©finition of linear independence

A set of vector $\alpha$ are linearly independent if the only way to make this equation hold is by setting all $\beta$ to 0 : 

$$\beta_1 \alpha_1 + \cdots + \beta_k \alpha_k = 0$$

If at least one $\beta_i$ is not 0, and the equation still hold, then the set is linearly dependent.

Ex a) Show that the vectors (1,2) and (3,4) are linearly independent.

For small quantities of small vectors, one easy test is to see if we can obtain one vector by multiplying a set of the others : 

$$\beta\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\2

\end{bmatrix}
=
-\begin{bmatrix}
3 \\4

\end{bmatrix}$$

(Note : this above notation is just the first equation re-written)

Here, it's obvious that there are no $\beta$ value that make this equation true. So. the set of vector is linearly independent. This becomes much harder to do with more, bigger vectors. I'll do the exercice b) with a standard method.

### Part 3

 Let w =(1,1,0,0),x = (1,0,1,0),y = (0,0,1,1), and z = (0,1,0,1).

Part a : 
![exercice 2 Part 3 a](images\Ex2\Ex2Part3_a.jpeg)

So : 

$$\mathbf{u} \in \text{span}\{\mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{z}\} \iff a = 4$$
$$\mathbf{u} \notin \text{span}\{\mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{z}\} \iff a \neq 4$$

Part b

Part c : 
![exercice 2 Part 3 c](images\Ex2\Ex2Part3_c.jpeg)

$$\mathbb{c}_1\mathbb{w} + \mathbb{c}_2\mathbb{x} + \mathbb{c}_3\mathbb{y} = \mathbb{z} \iff \mathbb{c}_1 = 1, \mathbb{c}_2 = -1, \mathbb{c}_3 = 1$$

Since there exist an answer other than having all $\mathbb{c}$ to 0, the set $\set{w,x,y,z}$ is linearly dependent
